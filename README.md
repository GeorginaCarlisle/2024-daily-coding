# 2024 Daily Coding Challenge

By building a habit of coding daily during 2024, I hope to:
- Embed the knowledge and skills I have already learnt
- Gain a deeper understanding of the Fundamentals
- Learn and explore new concepts and further expand my knowledge and skills

I will aim, every day to:
- Spend 15 mins coding
- At the end of the 15 minutes commit the days work to github

Potential Challenges:
- Actually taking out 15 mins every day to sit and do something unlinked to whatever else is happening that day.
- Sticking to 15 mins and not letting time run over
- Deciding what to focus on and what to code

## Languages

HTML
JavaScript

## January

Key Focus - JavaScript Fundamentals

Reason for focus - During the month of January I will be taking my first steps into the world of react, so it felt appropriate to go back over the fundamentals of Javascript to aid me in my learning of react.

1 - Basic semantic HTML structure
2 - JavaScript log added
3 - Additional log added on DOM content loaded
4 - CSS file in place and some basic layout styling added
5 - Fix printLog function to append children rather than just add a contents to the div. Correctly code window.onload to call a function.
6 - Additional JavaScript pages added ready for later. Barebones only.
7 - Basic unload function added.
8 - Further exploration of the beforeunload event, including how it is best to use only when there is a danger of user input being lost. Unload function removed, to be added again only for instances where it is needed.
9 - Basic click event added - called from the html.
10 - Extra details pulled from the event object created on click.
11 - Add CSS to tidy up how the log is displaying.
12 - Basic mouse enter and mouse leave events added.
